## Install

Once everything has been installed it's time to install and run TPM. First clone the git repository into ~/.tmux/plugins.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

After running stow the TMP should be initialized. All that is left is to open a tmux session and press `prefix + I` (capital i, as in Install) to fetch the plugins.
